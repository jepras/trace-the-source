# Project: Trace the source

## Tech Stack
- Python for creating Notebooks. Most code will just be run in Notebooks.
- Genius API for song data
- OpenAI SDK for song analysis

## Key Requirements
- Use official Genius API documentation patterns
- Implement proper error handling for both APIs
- Follow OpenAI best practices for prompt engineering

## API Guidelines
- Genius API: Always include required headers, handle rate limits
- OpenAI: Use structured outputs when possible, implement token counting & limits to avoid expenses
- Store API keys in environment variables
